Website with local music events:

Main Goal:
Pull events from API and display them in a list, with links to tickets to buy (including facebook
event link, and share button.

	1. Use IP address to track events near current location





Other features to be added later:
	1. Sort by date, over or under 18, genre and/or popularity
		1.2 Save favourited search filters
	2. Show travel time to event (google maps integration)
	3. User's can login and keep track of events they clicked 'going' to
	4. Ticket holding functionality which links their account with what application holds their ticket
	status (e.g. Ticketek, Moshtix). Also wallet function.
	5. Past event history (as well as attended events by the user)
	6. At phone widths, allow for the user to change between list and panel view
	(and filter by how many items to load each page, although this part should be automated based on scroll ideally)
	7. Event reminders for 7 days, 3 days, 1 day and 3 hours before event




To use:
	Bootstrap for responsiveness
	Node.js for back end
	React? (will need to investigate use of React to see if its worth adding as of now)
